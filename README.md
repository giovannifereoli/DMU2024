## ASEN5264: Decision Making under Uncertainty

Covers algorithms for optimal sequential decision making in the presence of uncertainty. Mathematical formalisms include the Markov decision process (MDP),
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and Games. Solution techniques include exact dynamic programming, Monte Carlo tree search, 
deep reinforcement learning, and alpha vector value approximation for POMDPs.
